## Scraper

This is a poetry project and you can install all the dependencies using `poetry install`

You would need to change the variables: `email, password, base_url` and obtain a python version specified in the `.python-version` file. 

To do that you can use pyenv. 
  - `pyenv install 3.10.13`
  - `pyenv local 3.10.13`
